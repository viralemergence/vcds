# The COMET data standard 🦟✍️🔢

In this repository, you can find a blank Excel (.xlsx) file that accompanies the below preprint:

> VY Wu, B Chen, R Christofferson, G Ebel, AC Fagre, E Gallichotte, AR Sweeny, CJ Carlson, SJ Ryan. A minimum reporting standard for raw data and metadata from mosquito arboviral competence experiments. _DOI Forthcoming_.

How should you use this repository?
- We suggest attaching a formatted raw dataset to your publications as a supplementary file / table
- A blank template for reporting is available in Excel format in "Blank template.xlsx"
- The template will be version-controlled with Zenodo, and major releases will demarcate formal versions of the template. 
- You can also see an example of how the data template would be used in "Calvez demo data.xlsx" (see below)
