## Repository guide

### How to use the data standard:

We suggest attaching a formatted raw dataset to your publications as a supplementary file / table. A blank template is available in this repository in .xlsx format. If you share your data using the COMET template, you can also (send it to us)[egallich@colostate.edu] directly for inclusion in the (currently under construction) COMET database.

### How to cite:
