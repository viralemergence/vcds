# The COMET data standard 🦟✍️🔢

In this repository, you can find a blank Excel (.xlsx) file that accompanies the below preprint:

> VY Wu, B Chen, R Christofferson, G Ebel, AC Fagre, E Gallichotte, AR Sweeny, CJ Carlson, SJ Ryan. A minimum data standard for vector competence experiments. _ecoEvoRxiv_ DOI: 10.32942/osf.io/ex2s9.

How should you use this repository?
- We suggest attaching a formatted raw dataset to your publications as a supplementary file / table
- A blank template for reporting is available in Excel format in "Blank template.xlsx"
- Soon, the template will be version-controlled with a citeable Zenodo DOI. Major releases of this repository, which will update the version number of that DOI, will demarcate formal versions of the template as the accompanying study passes through peer review or is otherwise updated later. 
- You can also see an example of how the data template would be used in "Calvez demo data.xlsx" (see below)
